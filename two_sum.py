Approach 2: Two-pass Hash Table
Intuition

To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array. 
If the complement exists, we need to get its index. 
What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index? 
A hash table.

We can reduce the lookup time from O(n) to O(1) by trading space for speed. 
A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup in near constant time. 
I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a lookup could degenerate to O(n) time. 
However, lookup in a hash table should be amortized O(1) time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.

Algorithm

A simple implementation uses two iterations. 
In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table. 
Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement (targetâˆ’nums[i]) exists in the hash table. 
If it does exist, we return current element's index and its complement's index. 
Beware that the complement must not be nums[i] itself!'''

        if complement in hash and hash[complement] != i:
            return [i, hash[complement]]
